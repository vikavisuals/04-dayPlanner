## Description
A simple day planner that follows standard business hours. At the top of the page is a dynamic display of the date and time.
The current timeslot is displayed in the color green, past slots are grey, and future slots are a light purple.
There is a save button for each time slot, and once saved these tasks do not disappear after a page refresh.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Moment.js API
- Bootstrap
- Google Fonts

## Challenges
- This application required a fair amount of logic and critical thinking. Understanding how elements would speak to each other was crucial to understand, before I could begin building the application, even before pseudocode could take place.
Fully reading the documentation for Moment.js, and doing further searches on specific syntax, was a large part of this project.
- My primary difficulty was translating JavaScript into jQuery. I prefer to use Vanilla, so this was my first attempt in really understanding how jQuery works and how the syntax differs.
- I learned that I am very comfortable in quickly building HTML and CSS, and I gained a better understanding over how functions work. I gained clarity in how to manipulate Local Storage and textarea fields.
- When I came across a difficult issue, I searched the web for examples until something finally worked. However with this project, I refused to copy/paste another persons code, I wrote out various versions of the examples until something stuck with my specific situation.
